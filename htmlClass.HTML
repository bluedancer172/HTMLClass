<h1> HTML Class </h1>
<h3> Our HTML Class is all done online. We meet once a week through Google Meets, every Saturday at 8:30, and our classes range from 30 minutes to a max of 1 hour. </h3>
<h4 style="text-align:center; ;">We also have a Google Classroom where all assignments are posted, and a google hangouts, so we all can interact with eachother if we need help or to help someone else.</h4>

<h3 style="text-align:center;"> What do we do? </h3>
<h4 style="border:2px; color: #B0E0E6;"> In each class... </h4> 
<p> During each class, we start by (one by one) presenting our projects/proggress on our projects, and sometimes give constructive criticism to eachother. Next, we either going over a new topic or reviewing a old one.  Our information was all found through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools<a> . </p>
<h4 style="border:2px; color: #B0E0E6;"> Projects! </h4> 
<p>For the first few weeks, we worked on webpages that had a little bit of information about us(Basic facts, likes/dislikes,etc.).  The new topics we leart during class would often be then used in our webpages. After we learned a few new things and answered any questions, we would improve our webpages, until we finalized them. Once our "All About Me!" Webpages were done, we moved on to creating a webpage for the class, that had everyone's wepages on it!</p>
