<h1> HTML Class </h1>
<h3> Our HTML Class is all done online. We meet once a week through Google Meets, every Saturday at 8:30, and our classes range from 30 minutes to a max of 1 hour. We also have a Google Classroom where all assignments are posted, and a google hangouts, so we all can interact with eachother if we need help or to help someone else.</h3>
<h4> What do we do? </h4>
<p> For the first few weeks, we worked on webpages that had some facts and a little bit of information about us. During each online meeting (Through Google Meets), we would learn new concepts. These new concepts would either be presented through our teacher (Nawnit Raman) or one of the students. Our information was all found through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools<a>, which is a website that has lots of information on HTML, as well as other coding languages. We would go through one or two sections per class, near the begginging. These new topics would often be then used in our webpages. After we learned a few new things and answered any questions, we would present our webpages.  </p>
<p> Once we had finished and finalized our webpages, we moved on to another project, creating a webpage for the class, and adding everyone's webpages onto it! </p>
